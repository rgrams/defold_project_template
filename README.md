# Defold Project Template
An empty Defold project for creating new projects without the Defold dashboard. 

***Note: This is only for use with Editor 2!***  To use the original, stable, Defold editor you must create your projects through the Defold dashboard. However, I have been using Editor 2 just fine for a while now. Since they recently added bundling functionality to Editor 2 I haven't found any reason to use Editor 1. 

At the moment this is a totally barebones project with only the most basic scene set up so something appears when you run it. In the future I might add in some basic framework stuff that makes more sense than the built-ins. If you have any feedback on this please make an issue. 

#### Instructions:
1. Download a zip of this repo with the green "Clone or download" button. Unzip it wherever you want your project files to be and presumably rename the folder. 
2. If you haven't already, go to http://www.defold.com/, and download Editor 2 (the links in blue). Yes, you have to log in with your google account to use Defold. 
3. Start up Editor 2 and after the loading screen, click "From Disk". Locate and open the game.project file from this template.
4. Boom, now you have a fresh new Defold project that only exists on your hard drive. 

If you don't know how to use Defold, go through the [getting started tutorial](http://www.defold.com/tutorials/getting-started/) and then [*read the manual!*](http://www.defold.com/manuals/introduction/) It may seem a little boring but you will learn way faster that way than you would bumbling around by yourself, and save many hours of frustration.
